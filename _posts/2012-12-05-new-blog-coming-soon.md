It's 1:30 a.m. right and and I don't really feel like typing why I switched blog platforms, but here are some reason:
- WordPress can be overkill. While I still love it for client work, it's a ton of code for a basic blog. Jekyll keeps everything tidy and decouples logic and views better than WP.
- I can host my blog for free with Github Pages (or Heroku if I wanted.) I was paying WebFaction $9.50 a month to host the old site. Now, I saw about $10 a month. Hooray.
- Jekyll post are written in Markdown. I love Markdown so boom.
- Lastly, it's the best way for a hacker/programmer to express herself. Forget a full blown CMS. Roll simple, elegent, expressive code.
