* [__Firescraper__](http://firescraper.herokuapp.com) - Rails app that tracks wildfires in California. Built with Rails, Mechanize, Sass, d3.js and leaflet. Deployed for *$Free.99* on Heroku (*slow page load though*). This app uses a ton of rake tasks to scrape the [CAL-FIRE](#) website and build a basic API out of the page. [Source on Github](http://github.com/aboutaaron/fire-scraper).

* __ClearCache.js__ - Bookmarklet to clear page cache. Mostly used by me for production speed at [Los Angeles Times](http://latimes.com). Drag to your browser's bookmark bar and click on it to ... *clear the cache.* Click on it here for a demo __>>__ <a href="javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='/js/clearcache.js';})();" class="btn btn-mini">Drag this</a>

* [__Awards Calendar__](http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/#title) - I was asked by Times Entertainment staff to build a calendar that staff and readers could use to keep track of upcoming award show events. I took this opportunity to build something with [Tabletop.js](http://builtbybalance.com/Tabletop/). Since the app is powered by a Google Doc spreadsheet, web producers and reporters alike — or really anyone who can update an Excel spreadsheet — can update the app.

* [__Tagged Corporate Site__](http://about.tagged.com) - While working as a marketing intern for [Tagged, Inc](http://tagged.com), I was asked if I wanted to take a stab at redesiging their aging corporate page. I worked with the design firm [RHDG](http://rh-dg.com/) on the look and feel of the site. From there, I took their PSD files and used the excellent [Roots WordPress framework](http://www.rootstheme.com/) to bring the designs to the web. This was my first forary into client web work.
