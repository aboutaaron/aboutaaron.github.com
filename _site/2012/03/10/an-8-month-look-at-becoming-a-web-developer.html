    <section class="entry"><blockquote>"You definitely have the aptitude for it. You should learn to code."</blockquote>
<p>These two sentences have controlled my personal and occupational activity for the last eight months.</p>

<p>Back in May, I attended the <a href="http://nola11.nytimes-institute.com/">New York Times Student Journalism Institute</a>, a two-week program where young journalists of color received training from Times Company journalists. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pilhofer">Aron Pilhofer</a>, Interactive News Editor at the New York Times and co-founder of DocumentCloud, was my assigned editor.</p>

<p>I asked him to teach me anything about web development and he kicked it off with this:</p>
<pre>$ bash -s stable &lt;</pre>
<p>That’s the bash script to install <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>. It was daunting at first, but I felt like I was hacking the planet. He also made me change my terminal to the home-brew theme.</p>

<p>Then it was Rails time.</p>
<pre>class ClientsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
  end
end</pre>
<p>Watching him create web apps from the command line was one of the most enthralling things I had ever seen. It was like learning how to cast magic.</p>

<p>Flying back home to San Francisco, I couldn’t get Pilhofer’s call to code out my head. I panicked because I was close to graduating from San Francisco State University with a degree in Journalism, but I realized I wanted to start computer programming. Every intro to computer science course at SF State required calculus prerequisites, which I didn’t have time to do. I had enough time to pick up a second minor and thought I could do web design and at least learn front-end basics. However, due to budget cuts, the design department removed the minor.</p>

<p>I loved journalism, but I wanted to build tools to encourage and develop it. I wanted to be a news developer, but my department didn’t teach the skills I needed to become one. I thought about grad school, but that would be another two years of school without actually working in the real world, and an extra $50,000 to $80,000 in debt.</p>

<p>I decided that if I wanted to learn these skills, I couldn’t wait on my school to catch up or hope that my master’s degree would teach them to me. So, I went to Amazon.com and purchased several books:</p>
<ul>
	<li>XHTML and CSS fundamentals</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Silvanus-Phillips-Thompson/dp/1456531980/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336668963&amp;sr=1-4">Calculus Made Easy</a> by Silvanus Thompson (didn't end up finishing, but interesting nonetheless)</li>
	<li><a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Learn to Program</a> by Chris Pine (link to free e-book)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336668918&amp;sr=8-1">Don't Make Me Think</a> by Steve Krug</li>
</ul>
<p>As the summer went on, I also ended up purchasing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learning-PHP-MySQL-JavaScript-Step-By-Step/dp/0596157134/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1336669021&amp;sr=1-1">Learning PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript</a> by Robin Nixon</li>
</ul>
<p>I went through Learn to Program first. I found the book pretty easy to follow, and though the math parts took some extra reading, I was able to traverse the book fairly quickly.</p>

<p>As a result of that book, I made a quick program to calculate coffee doses for when I grind coffee in the morning.</p>
<pre>puts
puts 'Welcome to Aaron\'s coffee dosage module'
puts 'I will give you the amount of coffee you need'
puts 'based on the amount of water you provide'
puts
puts '*REMEMBER* this is all in grams!'
puts
puts 'What amount of water are you using?'
water = gets.chomp
puts
puts 'CALCULATING...'
puts
puts 'If you\'re using '+ water + 'g of water, you\'ll need'
puts
puts (water.to_i/10.9).to_s + 'g of coffee.'
puts
puts'Thank you for using my coffee calculator.'
puts</pre>
<p>The code was rough, but I actually created something useful (I still use it). I haven’t created a program since this one, but it showed me the usefulness of programming. I put Learn to Program down and picked up XHTML and CSS fundamentals.</p>

<p>The beauty of this book was that the author uses it to teach an intro web design course at the university she works at.</p>

<p>As a result, the pacing, exercises and content were very easy to learn and, though a bit dated, taught me the difference between semantics and style.</p>

<p>The result of this book was all the front-end work I did for <a href="http://goldengatexpress.org">The Golden Gate Xpress</a>.</p>

<p>Using Learn to Program and <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCast</a>, I wrote a scraper to print out the SF State Police crime log in the terminal:
    require ‘rubygems’
    require ‘nokogiri’
    require ‘open-uri’</p>

<pre><code>url = "http://www.sfsu.edu/~upd/crimelog/index.html"
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url))
puts doc.at_css("title").text
doc.css(".brief").each do |brief|
 puts brief.css("h3:nth-child(3) , p:nth-child(4), h3:nth-child(4), p:nth-child(5)").text
end Eight months later I've added plenty of skills to my repertoire:
</code></pre>
<ul>
	<li>LessCSS</li>
	<li>Git</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, almost a year later, I put most of these skills together to build the new corporate website for Tagged, Inc. (<a href="http://about.tagged.com">about.tagged.com</a>)</p>

<p>That site took some time (and a design team to help), but I’m really proud of what I accomplished.</p>

<p>So, this is all to say that as long as you have the time, and the aptitude (which you should), you can definitely learn a thing or two about the web.</p>

<p>Here’s to eight more months!</p>
