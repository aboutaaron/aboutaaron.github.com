    <section class="entry"><p>I graduate from San Francisco State University in a month.</p>

<p>After five long years of study, I will join the legions of optimistic, young Americans with quixotic dreams. It&#8217;s interesting because this is the end of my educational experience as an American citizen. My parents told me when I was a child that college would open up the most job opportunities later in life and that I could be anything.</p>

<p>They told me as a Black American that college would be the only way I could escape the <a href='http://www.kff.org/minorityhealth/upload/7541.pdf'>towering statistics facing black youth</a> (PDF).</p>

<p>So how do I feel now that I&#8217;ve succeeded in the goals? I feel scared. I feel lied to. And I&#8217;m not surprised. Most of my peers understand the seriousness of America&#8217;s economic situation. With trillions of dollars in debt, a shrinking middle class, and few new job opportunities, most of my friends are seeking other ways to supplement their incomes. The service industry comes to mind. To make matters worse, the CEO of Fox News <a href='http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/169950/roger-ailes-tells-journalism-students-i-think-you-ought-to-change-your-major/'>just encouraged</a> journalism majors to change their major. Forbes ran an article that called journalism the &#8221;<a href='http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffbercovici/2012/04/16/forget-that-survey-heres-why-journalism-is-the-best-job-ever/'>best job ever</a>,&#8221; but celebrity meetings don&#8217;t pay rent.</p>

<p>You could argue that passionate people are the masters of their destinies and that passion trumps profession. Kanye West comes to mind. But just as soon as Kanye released his 2004 début, &#8221;<a href='http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8767-the-college-dropout/'>The College Dropout</a>,&#8221; a brilliant record that lamented the false dreams I just mentioned above, West became a hiphop mega-star and began releasing tracks like &#8221;<a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/way-too-cold-feat.-dj-khaled/id519878861?i=519879089'>Way Too Cold</a>,&#8221; a braggadocio-filled track that champions his affluence.</p>

<p>Some say West sold out. Well he did. And you would too if you had opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not saying I agree with who West is now. I miss the sobering closeness and optimism displayed on his first record. But, I understand why West did what he did, and I understand why he is who he is now.</p>

<p>I bring up West not as a random tangent, but as an example. Here, you have a man who grew up in the Chicago suburbs who, despite his middle-class setting, loved and was influenced by hiphop culture. He studied art in and tried to take classes at the local college and ran into the same bullshit all college students have over the past 10 years: canceled classes, full classes, not enough students, too many students, unmet pre-requisites, student loans, etc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he was producing for local Chicago acts, and through determination and luck, he ended up producing for Jay-Z. More than a decade later, West has released a fashion line and has a record label. The psuedo-Marxist in me wants to say West is clearly participating in capitalism and globalization, cross promoting his brand and finding markets to exploit. That&#8217;s probably true. However, I&#8217;m more inclined to think that this is a man with too much on his mind to let music be the only avenue he&#8217;s creative in. He&#8217;s a trained artist and now uses those talents to create fashion.</p>

<p>We as human beings have an infinite creative capacity. At my last job, I met a computer programmer who was also an orchestra bassist. I&#8217;ve met baristas who are trained sculptors. I think many people find the jobs that pay the bills and pursue personal interests elsewhere.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s my point. Why do occupation and interest have to live in a dichotomy? I often hear people say, &#8221;I&#8217;m passionate about X, but I <em>love</em> doing Y. I wish I had a job that joined the two.&#8221; And that&#8217;s the dream, right? We find <strong><em>one</em></strong> job that does it all. But, I&#8217;d like to offer that all of human kind, especially young people, should pursue all of their interests. And in fact, you should just learn for the sake of learning and possibly gain interest from there.</p>

<p>I studied journalism because I loved writing and found searching for stories exhilarating. That said, many journalism jobs are becoming non-existent. My home in the Bay Area suffered a heavy loss in media jobs. The San Francisco Public Press did a <a href='http://spot.us/pitches/876-how-the-media-meltdown-is-leaving-bay-area-residents-in-the-dark/story'>great package piece on bay area job loss</a> if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

<p>I was interested in computer programming and web development, but I didn&#8217;t have the pre-requisites necessary to take the intro level classes offered at SF State. It also didn&#8217;t help that my academic advisor at the time discouraged me from taking a minor in computer science because it was a &#8220;separate skill.&#8221; Thanks to the power of the Internet (and Amazon Books), however, I taught myself a ton and recently completed my first web development project for <a href='http://about.tagged.com'>Tagged, Inc</a>. This project took several months to complete and required tons of learning on the job, as well as help from experienced developers.</p>

<p>But hey, I coded a website after learning how to do so 8 months prior. And through all this, I&#8217;ve found a new passion that has opened up new job opportunities that I wouldn&#8217;t have if I had just stuck with my degree. That’a not to say that my project is perfect. I&#8217;ve already thought of several improvements the site could use from both technical and use standpoints. Furthermore, I&#8217;m sure there are things I did incorrectly that I&#8217;ll notice as I learn more. But, it&#8217;s rather surreal that I actually was a part of shipping a website redesign. I couldn&#8217;t even fathom doing that 4 months ago.</p>

<p>To be clear, it&#8217;s hard to stretch every skill equally during an extended amount of time. I&#8217;ve invested much more time into learning how to program than practicing my writing or freelancing. Part of this has to do with my personal view of how I should do journalism, but it has more to do with the fact that I don&#8217;t want to burn out too quickly. And honestly, learning how to program is more fun than writing 500-word stories. But, that&#8217;s just how I feel now.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, human beings have an amazing capacity to learn. And I feel like some of our best potential is squandered thinking about things in singular ways. I am at crossroads in my life. I love programming, journalism and coffee. I have experience in all three and have to choose which to hone more than the others. It&#8217;s a tough call, but I&#8217;m determined to make sure that no matter my job, I&#8217;ll work on all three.</p>

<p>I originally called this post &#8220;The New Renaissance Man&#8221; because I&#8217;m inspired by the people during that period. As a philosophy minor, I read countless works by renaissance and enlightenment philosophers who not only pushed how we conceived of the world, but also how pushed how we can add to it. I recall <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes'>René Descartes</a>, who not only contributed to western philosophy with his famous phrase &#8221;<a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QE8dL1SweCw'>cogito ergo sum</a>,&#8221; but also bridged the gap between algebraic expressions and geometry via <a href='http://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/introduction-to-algebra/v/descartes-and-cartesian-coordinates'>Cartesian coordinates</a>.</p>

<p>The 21st Century is here, and learning, collaborating, and creating has <a href='http://codecademy.com'>never</a> <a href='http://udacity.com'>been</a> <a href='http://khanacademy.com'>easier</a> for those with internet access (the digital divide is another blog post—here&#8217;s a <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/04/opinion/sunday/internet-access-and-the-new-divide.html?pagewanted=all'>New York Times piece</a> on it). I will continue to push my own limits and fight against those who plan on taking these rights away from others.</p></section>
