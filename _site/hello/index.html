                <h3 id="tldr">Dear Alyssa,</h3>

                <p>I can't remember the precise moment we met. Our friendship came like a blur. We were young, hormone-fueled, awkward and confused (at least I was). But that's the beauty of youth — it's about about figuring yourself out.
                </p>
                <p>Speaking of, I could never figure you out. I remember seeing you in that Strong Bad hoodie in the 20s row at Washington and thinking, "Holy shit this girl likes Strong Bad" (I wasn't a particularly complex thinker back then). I mentioned your attire, you smiled with wide eyes and we talked for about 40 seconds. Then we went our respective ways to our respective friends. We'd occasionally be in the same social circles but not too often — you hung out with the theater and AP kids and I with the Filipino b-boys.
                </p>
                <p>I was rather raucous back then. I demanded attention and would often do outlandish things in order to be noticed. It was during Mrs. Kling's stats class in 2007 that I believe my flailing caught your attention. It was also in this class that your humor caught mine. Then that smile! Then those eyes! Then "holy shit I think I'm attracted to this girl."
                </p>
                <p>Since, that attraction has been omnipresent in my life like a cat's need to destroy a couch(very strong).
                </p>
                <p>It's always been your eyes. You have this sarcastic-yet-sweet look that slays me. I often noticed it as we held hands — the look usually came after I said something stupid. I like to act "put together," but not around you. I can't. The programming, Black, journalist fancyman crumbles and I'm just Aaron. I can only do that with you.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, I threw that all way. Well, I did so on several occasions, the last culminating with me lying to you about talking to another woman. I've replayed that episode incessantly in my head for what seems like eons and I've yet to find peace with myself (not that you should care). I've asked myself every day since, "Why would you hurt someone you've cared about so much for so long?" While selfishness, greed, lust and stupidity are at the top of the list, I think it actually comes down to one word: fear.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="scrollblock" id="im-sorry">
                    <p id="tldr">I'm so sorry.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Alyssa, you know me more intimately than anyone and that scared me. It still does. I'm not trying to justify cheating. That's some bullshit. But, after some meditating, I came realize I often reject that which I can't control.
                </p>
                <p>Alas, I think I'm finally okay with admitting something I've known for years:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="scrollblock" id="i-love-you">
                    Alyssa, I am in love you.
                </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Now, I know we played around with this phrase a couple of times, and my track record of infidelity and assholeness may make this seem counterfeit but I promise this is absolutely, 100 percent honest and true.
                </p>
                <p>You're just so incredible! You don't take my shit, you're the best hugger in the western hemisphere, your baked goods borderline crack addictiveness and you're possibly the only person on this planet I can say "pew pew pew" to without them thinking I'm insane.
                </p>
                <p>You can look sexy-and-you-know-it-clap-your-hands at the drop of a dime but have no problem rocking a hoodie and some jeans 'cause they're comfy. You're the first to listen to my ideas, no matter how asinine, and you've been my biggest supporter for what seems like forever.
                </p>
                <p>You're kind as hell and patient with all the morons you meet. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's why you have no enemies. Who could hate you? (Can't confirm if old man cat has a grudge, but we'll discuss that later.)
                </p>
                <p>Finally, you're just beautiful inside in and out. No one I've met has ever matched your beauty, your tact and your grace. It's breathtaking to watch, which is why I partially think my asthma hasn't gotten better. But, it's totally worth it.</p>
                <p>Los Angeles, in many ways, gave me an opportunity to run away from my ghost back in the Bay. It represented me running away from what I've done and hiding from the people I've hurt. And while I like it down here, I've come to realize that there's no point in building a life if you can't share it with the person you love.
                </p>
                <p>This is tough for me to say because I know that there's a high chance you'll reject this letter. You may care for me but your heart is battered. And though part of you may want to try this again, you may not know if it'll wind up like it always has. Furthermore, I'm sure your friends and family won't find our reunion too attractive. I get that.
                </p>
                <p>Not only that, I'm pretty sure you don't want to move to Los Angeles. I'm (kind of) fine with that and I really want you to get that awesome San Francisco apartment with Betsy and wild out in North Beach. More than anything, I just want you to be happy.
                </p>
                <p>But, I also decided that acting as if I can just be a friendly face isn't fair to you or me anymore. You're not just one of my best friends — you're <em>the</em> friend. It pains me to go more than 48 hours without talking to you. I miss you like a fat kid misses the ice cream truck during the winter months (and not just the regular ice cream trucks but the ones that have nachos and stuff).
                </p>

                <p>I just want you to know that you are loved — loved oh so much. And though I've made many mistakes, I've owned up to them and I, more than anything, want to be the person, the friend, the compadre, the boyfriend you deserve. I want to fight for the girl that never leaves my mind's eye, that I'd do anything for, that I'd wrestle alligators for, the girl I'd start listening to musicals for, the girl I'd write serial commas for knowing it's probably driving her crazy.

                <p>There's a lot to talk about after you read this. We gotta talk about what this all means given we live some 300-plus miles away from each other. We gotta talk about the healing that must commence if anything is supposed to happen between us. I'm sure that'll all happen in the coming days.
                </p>
                <p>Just know for now that I'm fully prepared to wait however long it takes for this to work out. You're so worth it.
                </p>
                <p>Also, the thought of you watching a competitive taxidermy show on Valentine's Day makes my blood boil. So I built you this handy-dandy website.
                </p>
                <p>You're an amazing woman. Thanks for being in my life.</p>
