title: About
---

I started programming seriously around two years ago thinking I'd never get this far. Calling myself a "web developer" seemed like a distant dream back then. And yet, through perserverance — and a lot of coffee — I think I've done pretty well for myself.

I like JavaScript, Ruby, Object-oriented practices and HTML prototypes. I don't know if I fancy myself a frontend or backend dev. **I just like to code.**

I'm a Bay Area native currently residing in Los Angeles. I quite enjoy coffee, hip-hop and my excellent girlfriend.

### Colophon

This site is powered by the following technologies:

* [Lora](http://google.com/webfonts)

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

* [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)

* [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)

#### Design
For this site redesign, I wanted something simple, yet functional. I moved the blogging feature off to [Tumblr](http://blog.aboutaaron.com), gutted Bootstrap's Less files for the Sass variant and began asking myself, "What represents *me*?" What's left is a site that's easy to maintain and a breeze to update. Also, dinosuars!

Special thanks to:

* [Mark Otto](http://markdotto.com/) - Mark built Bootstrap. This site is built with Booststrap. Nuff said.

* [Beta Prime](http://betaprime.tumblr.com) - I took [Evan Walsh's](http://evanwalsh.net/) simplistic Tumblr theme and rehauled it for [my blog](http://blog.aboutaaron.com). The aesthetic carried over to this site.

* [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/) - Marco's fanstastic website inspired the simple-but-focused look to my web presence.

* [Troy Eric Griggs](http://troyericgriggs.com/) - Troy, my fusion dance compadre, is a New York-based designer and web developer currently working for the New York Times. He's also a kick ass designer. Hire him.

* [Gastrolito](http://gastrolito.deviantart.com/art/quot-Tyrannosaurus-rex-quot-72353695) - He drew the dinosaur.
