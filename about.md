title: About
---

I am journalist who tends to speak more with code than words.

I've spent the last couple of years transitioning from news writing and editing to computer programming. Over the course of two years, I've taught myself the foundations of computer programming, web design and web development and plan to focus my career down that pipeline. Most recently, I helped conceptualize, design and build the corporate/marketing website for Tagged, Inc. and currently wrangle code for the Los Angeles Times.

I am always interested in new opportunities, ways to learn and all things computer science related.

My goal is to work at major media-driven company doing web development and programming.
