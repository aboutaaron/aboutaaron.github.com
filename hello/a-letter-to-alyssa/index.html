                <h3 id="tldr">Dear Alyssa,</h3>

                <p>I can't remember the precise moment we met. Our friendship came like a blur. We were young, hormone-fueled, awkward and confused (at least I was). But that's the beauty of youth — it's about about figuring yourself out.
                </p>
                <p>Speaking of, I could never figure you out. I remember seeing you in that Strong Bad hoodie in the 20s row at Washington and thinking, "Holy shit this girl likes Strong Bad" (I wasn't a particularly complex thinker back then). I mentioned your attire, you smiled with wide eyes and we talked for about 40 seconds. Then we went our respective ways to our respective friends. We'd occasionally be in the same social circles but not too often. You hung out with the theater and AP kids and I spent most of time with Filipino b-boys.
                </p>
                <p>I was rather raucous back then. I demanded attention and would often do outlandish things in order to be noticed. I'm not much different now, though I posses some tact to my attention-whoring. Anyway, it was during Mrs. Kling's stats class in 2007 that my flailing caught your attention. It was also in this class that your humor caught mine. Then that smile! Then those eyes! Then "holy shit I think I'm attracted to this girl."
                </p>
                <p>That attraction has been omnipresent in my life like a cat's need to destroy a couch ever since (very strong!)
                </p>
                <p>It's always been your eyes. You have this sarcastic-yet-sweet look that slays me. I often noticed as we held hands — it usually came after I said something stupid. I like to act "put together," but not around you. I can't. The programming, Black, journalist fancyman crumbles and I'm just Aaron. I can only do that with you.
                </p>
                <p>Of course, I threw that all way. Well, I did so on several occasions, the last culminating with me lying to you about talking to another woman. I've replayed that episode incessantly in my head for what seems like eons and I've yet to find peace with myself (not that you should care). I've asked myself every day since, "Why would you hurt someone you've cared about so much for so long?" While selfishness, greed, lust and stupidity are at the top of the list, I think it actually comes down to one word: fear.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="scrollblock" id="im-sorry">
                    <p id="tldr">I'm so sorry.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Alyssa, you know me more intimately than anyone and that scared me. It still does. I'm not trying to justify cheating. That's some bullshit. But, after some meditating, I came realize I often reject that which I can't control.
                </p>
                <p>Alas, I think I'm finally okay with admitting something I've known for years:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="scrollblock" id="i-love-you">
                    I am in love you.
                </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Now, I know we played with this phrase on several occasions, and my track record of infidelity and assholeness may make this seem counterfeit but it's true.
                </p>
                <p>You're just so incredible! You don't take my shit, you're the best hugger in the western hemisphere, your baked goods borderline crack addictiveness and you're possibly the only person on this planet I can say "pew pew pew" to without them thinking I'm insane. I've always known you're an incredible person, but I think I've finally let my guard down enough to know that you're also someone I want to build more with.
                </p>
                <p>You can look sexy-and-you-know-it-clap-your-hands when you want to but have no problem rocking a hoodie and some jeans. You're the first to listen to my ideas, no matter how asinine, and you've been my biggest supporter for a long time.
                </p>
                <p>Los Angeles, in many ways, gave me an opportunity to run away from my ghost back in the Bay. And while I like it down here, it's killing me not having you around.
                </p>
                <p>This is tough for me to say because I know that there's a high chance you'll reject this letter. You may care for me but your heart is battered. And though part of you may want to try this again, you may not know if it'll wind up like it always has. Furthermore, I'm sure your friends and family won't find our reunion too attractive. I get that. I'm fully prepared for you to turn down this declaration.
                </p>
                <p>Not only that, I'm pretty sure you don't want to move to Los Angeles. I'm (kind of) fine with that and I really want you to get that awesome San Francisco apartment with Betsy and wild out in North Beach. More than anything, I just want you to be happy.
                </p>
                <p>But, I also decided that acting as if I can just be a friendly face isn't fair to you or me anymore. You're not just one of my best friends — you're the friend. It pains me to go more than 48 hours without talking to you. I miss you like a fat kid misses the ice cream truck during the winter months (and not just the regular ice cream trucks but the ones that have nachos and stuff). There's this longing that I can't get away from.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>There's a lot to talk about after you read this. We gotta talk about what this all means given we live some 300-plus miles away from each other. We gotta talk about the healing that must commence if anything is supposed to happen. I'm sure that'll all happen in the coming days.
                </p>
                <p>But for now, in this moment, I just want you to know that you are loved so incredibly much. And that though I've been the worst human being you've come into contact with, I'm so unabashedly in love with you.
                </p>
                <p>Los Angeles is great, but I just don't know how long I can deal with you not being around. This, plus my mother's minor plea back in January, have convinced me that maybe it's time to return home. I'm not saying it'll come to that, but for once in my life, I want to fight for something more than just myself.
                </p>
                <blockquote id="tldr">
                    And it's you Alyssa.
                </blockquote>
                <p>We're busy people and maybe none of this will happen in 2013 — perhaps not even the year after either. I also don't expect for you to wait for me. But, I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I want something more for us.
                </p>
                <p>Also, the thought of you watching a competitive taxidermy show on Valentine's Day makes my blood boil. So I decided to spill my heart to you.
                </p>
                <p>You're amazing girl. Thanks for being in my life.
