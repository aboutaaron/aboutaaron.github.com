<h1>Letter to Alyssa</h1>

<p>I'm writing this letter much later than I should have. This letter contains almost a year's worth of emotion, regret and alcoholism thrown into one. I have so much to say, but I'm trying to get better at being succinct, pithy and "to the point." I plan to send you this letter on Valentine's Day because it was a year ago, today, that I royally fucked up what we had. And with that, I issue you the following treatise:
</p>
<p>I love you. I <strong>fucking</strong> love you so fucking much. Excuse the swearing, but with matters as intense as this, sometimes vulgarity has its place. No, but really, I <strong>fucking</strong> love you. I'm totally in love with you and have been so since senior year of high school. And while this conversation may have remnants of our past romances, these current declarations come from a man who has squandered a treasure he once had. It's from a place of despair — this is a dirge with a love letter woven in between.
</p>
<p>When I cheated on you — and boy has it taken me a long time to officially admit that I did that to you and myself — I did it because I thought I didn't need you. In fact, I thought I needed no one. You know my goal-driven, megalomanic persona more than anyone. I reveled in it and thought relationships … relationships are for the dependent — for those without fully realized goals. I had my goals. I had my dreams. I had my aspirations and I wanted <strong>no one</strong> to interfere with them.
</p>
<p>And yet, here I sit lonely, broken and ashamed. I'm slowly making my dreams a reality and while I have people in my life to share them with, I am not able to fully share them with the one person who I wish I could do so with — <strong>You.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alyssa, you are the most unusual, gorgeous, off-kilter, reserved, forgiving, loving, judgmental, grace-giving, sharp, tactful, accepting, fragrant (running out of adjectives are we?), BEAUTIFUL person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. You've opened up to me about the death of your mother, your insecurities and all the rest. 
</p>
<p>And yet, while you known much of my heart's desires, you know none of its pain. I've done this on purpose because I never wanted to share any of my pain with anyone. It's a reservoir I've kept hidden from the world for I'm afraid to show what I am — an adulterer, an insecure male, a goal driven person only because he's afraid to fall and have no one love him. I fear this world as much as I scream <em>Me temo que nada</em>.
</p>
<p>So, why am I writing you this letter? I'm writing because I don't know what else to do with us. 
</p>
<p>I want you back. 
</p>
<p>I can't think of anyone else I want to continue this wild life with. I've stopped myself from writing this letter on several occasions because I felt like you deserved better. I still think you do. You deserve someone that doesn't continually break you, scold you, toss you around at their whimsy. You deserve a love that's rich, saturating, honest and life-affirming. I have failed on all accounts to supply you with anything close to that. Furthermore, where the fuck do I get the <em>cajones</em> to ask you to come back in my life? Not only did I betray our trust (on several occasions), but I did so in such blatant disrespect to what we had built that you'd be foolish to even consider this proposal. In fact, anything you do with me will come off as an interrobang (‽). I respect your father and your friends. I don't want you to come off as the foolish girl and I don't want to be the controlling, asshole boy. 
</p>
<p>But, Alyssa, I miss you so much. It's fucking me up. I was half hoping you would meet someone by now. I was prepared to meet a guy I was gonna have to act like I cared about but secretly hate. Since that hasn't happened, I'm going to try and prevent that.
</p>
<p>I don't know what to call this. This is equal parts love letter and confession. I've created a mess of all of this. However, we're 23 years old and we both (hopefully) at least have another 20-plus years going for us. 
</p>
<p>I'm not asking you to marry me. I just want to be your man again. I want to take care of you. I want to be the person you cry to when life sucks. I want to be the guy you run to when you succeed. I don't deserve the title, but I want it more than anything.
</p>
<p>I thought moving to L.A. would make this all change. But now, I just want you down here. When I told you I thought about moving back to the Bay, I only wanted to do it for two reasons — my mother and you.
</p>
